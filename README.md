# Jimg-compression
Jimg is an image compression script that looses a little bit of quality in exchange for ~2x compression!!

## how it works!!

ok so! This is an advanced script for ADVANCED PROGRAMMERS ONLY so if you are not an advanced programmer buckle up...

To compress it goes pixel by pixel and if the pixels that are next to each other are pretty similar in color then it lumps them together! Boom! Up to 100 pixels can be grouped together at a time. Not sure exact compression amount possible but from my small tests it gets to about 2x compression on a PNG, with a 3kx4k JPG it got ~2.5x! 

Jimg is the future!
